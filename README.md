# How it work

**1- HTML Email Template**: The mailContent variable holds a long string containing an HTML email template. The template is styled with inline CSS to ensure consistent rendering across different email clients.

**2- Placeholders**: The HTML template contains several placeholder strings like `__companySite__`, `__logoURL__`, `__altLogo__`, etc. These placeholders act as markers for specific content that needs to be dynamically replaced.

**3- Replace Function**: The script utilizes a custom `replaceAll` function (is a function in zoho deluge) to replace each occurrence of the placeholders with actual values. For example, `__companySite__` will be replaced with the URL of the Mercedes-Benz website, and so on.

**4- Email Content Customization**: After the replaceAll function is called for each placeholder, the email content becomes personalized with specific details like the recipient's name, the date, the body text of the email, a list of reasons why the recipient won, and a call-to-action button.

**5- Sending Email**: At the end of the script, there is a sendmail function that sends the personalized email to the recipient's email address.
